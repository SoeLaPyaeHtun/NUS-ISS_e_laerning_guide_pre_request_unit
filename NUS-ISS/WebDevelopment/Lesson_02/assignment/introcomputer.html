        <h1>Introduction to Computers</h1>

        <h3>History of Computers</h3>
        <p>One of the earliest machines designed to assist people in calcliations was the <b> abacus </b> is still being used some 5000 years after its invention</p>
        <p>In 1642 Blaise Pascal (a famous French mathematician) invented an adding machine based on mechanical gears in which numbers were represented by the cogs
            on the wheels.</p>
        <p>Englishman, Charles Babbage, invented in the 1830's a "Difference Engine" made out of brass and pewter rods and gears, and also designed a further device
            which he called an "Analytical Engine", His design contained the five key characteristics of modern computers;-</p>

        <ol>
            <li>An input device</li>
            <li>Storage for numbers waiting to be processed</li>
            <li>A processor or number calcliator</li>
            <li>A unit to control the task and the swquence of its calcliations</li>
            <li>An output device</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Augusta Ada Byron (later Countess of Lovelace) was an associate of Babbage who has become known as the first computer programmer.</p>
        <h3>Computer Parts</h3>
        <h4>Central Processing Unit</h4>
        <p><b>À central processing unit (CPU)</b> is the electronie circuitrywithin acomputer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic
            arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output(I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer Industry has used the term "central processing unit" at
            east since the early 19605 [1]</p>
        <h4>Keyboard</h4>
        <p><img src="keyboard.png" alt="" style="float: right;" width="140" height="70"> A computer keyboard is a typewriter-style device which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or
            electronic switches. Following the decline of punch cards and paper tape, Interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards became the
            main input method for computers,Keyboard kèys (buttons) typically have characters engraved or printed on them.[2] and each press
            of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol, However, producing some symbols may require pressing and holding
            several keys simultaneously or in sequence. While most keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or signs (characters), other keys or
            simultaneous key presses can produce actions or execute computer commands. In normal usage, the keyboard is used as a text entry interface for typing text
            and numbers into a word processor, text editor or any other program. In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software. A
            computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other key and reports all key presses to the controlling software.</p>
